    <h1>What are the BTHS majors?</h1>
    <p id="Aerospace">
        <h2>Aerospace</h2>
        Aerospace Engineering consists of the research, design, development, construction, and testing of aircraft and spacecraft. The Aerospace Engineering Major at Brooklyn Tech allows students to explore their interests in aviation and space, while learning how to apply theory toward solving practical problems. 
        Aviation and space technologies are typically at the cutting-edge because of the need to produce vehicles that are strong, but extremely light weight.
        Aerospace Engineering incorporates many aspects of the other disciplines in engineering; mechanical, electrical, structural, and materials, as well as requiring a sound foundation in all sciences and mathematics. Students will develop skills in flying aircraft in order to ensure that they can test their virtual designs, and to provide a better sense of which design features of aircraft and spacecraft are essential for a successful design.

    <p id="Architecture">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.
        Students may consider the architecture major if they are interested in pursuing careers in architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, construction management, project management, or related fields.  The proficiencies acquired in the architecture major such as applied problem solving via the design process, graphic communication and oral presentation skills, basic building construction expertise and the ability to read and interpret blueprints are invaluable competencies in life.
